# Making Digital Twins Work

## Notes

True value of digital twin technology lies in interoperability

"This article posits that the single greatest requisite to making digital twin technology work is the creation of a set of standards—a framework—and an ecosystem that support the interoperability of applications and systems using digital twins across the technology silos in technology, applications, and vertical markets as well as across academia, R&D, and industry."

All digital twins should consist of the following elements:

1. the physical twin
1. the virtual twin
1. the communication channel of data and information between the two.

A digital twin should represent and describe its physical twin in whatever manner, scope, and detail are appropriate for the intended use of the twinning being constructed - to support the purpose behind the creation of the association between the real-world and virtual objects
