	abstract = {With the booming of cloud-based digital twin systems, monitoring key performance indicators has become crucial for ensuring system security and reliability. Due to the massive amount of monitoring data generated, data compression is necessary to save data transmission bandwidth and storage space. Although the existing research has proposed compression methods for multivariate time series (MTS), it is still a challenge to guarantee the correlation between data when compressing the MTS. This paper proposes an MTS Collaborative Compression (MTSCC) method based on the two-step compression scheme. First, shape-based clustering is implemented to group the MTS. Afterward, the compressed sensing is optimized to achieve collaborative compression of grouped data. Based on a real-world MTS dataset, the experimental results show that the proposed MTSCC can effectively preserve the complex temporal correlation between indicators while achieving efficient data compression, and the root mean squared error of correlation between the reconstructed and original data is only 0.0489 in the case of 30\% compression ratio. Besides, it is verified that using the reconstructed data in the production environment has almost the same performance as using the original data. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As the simulation model of a physical system, digital twin has been widely used in many complicated control systems. Providing an effective way to perform simulation, digital twin makes the evaluation, prediction and optimization process cheaper and easier than on physical systems. For smart manufacturing, digital twin achieves high productivity with less operation and maintenance cost. However, the advantages of digital twin in anomaly detection during manufacturing are always neglected. Taking a two-speed transmission system as an example, we generate three kinds of faults on this digital twin model. After extracting features from the system output, we train an anomaly detection model on these features to classify each type of fault. By this digital twin model, we can find the fault in the whole system at the very beginning, and reduce the time and cost of debugging and diagnosing.},

	abstract = {Implementing closed-loop control requires ensuring a robust system response against undesired disturbances and random fault events. To overcome these challenges, the controllers must be able to detect and adapt the process behavior against undesired events by adjusting its parameters accordingly. Developers have utilized the concept of a digital twin—a real-time representation of the physical process—to design and update the physical controller effectively. However, traditional digital twin implementations often involve significant data exchange between the digital system and the real asset through cloud platforms, leading to data latency and privacy issues. To mitigate these concerns, we propose an FPGA-based digital twin implementation where the information is directly sourced into the Digital Twin from the physical asset, which runs in parallel with the real system. This setup eliminates the need for big data transfers and cloud uploads, ensuring enhanced data privacy and facilitating a faster and more efficient digital twin implementation and update process. To demonstrate the capabilities of embedded Digital Twin, we present a case study involving monitoring a power converter system during a sensor fault scenario.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, along with the application of new-generation information technologies in industry and manufacturing, the big data-driven manufacturing era is coming. However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively.},

This paper focuses on the design phase of automation systems, especially creating a digital twin of a machine to support the software development of the control system and its virtual commissioning. Different simulation model architectures are introduced, as well as specific use-case. The main objective of this paper is to present three basic types of digital twin architectures for virtual commissioning of production devices and systems. These architectures were investigated and built based on predefined requirements. Collaborative project work for the development of the digital twin and efficiency was defined as one of the requirements. Efficiency is required due to the software and hardware used for the digital twin. Architectures such as centralized, basic distributed and completely distributed were introduced in the paper. Based on the results from observation and testing, the authors recommend using the concept of completely distributed architecture of the digital twin based on the defined requirements. This digital twin architecture separates mechanical engineering and automation engineering with respect to PC stations. Nevertheless, it interconnects them using the standard machine-to-machine software and communication interfaces.},

	abstract = {The concept of twinning an operational physical system with a functional replica is not new, having been practiced in the space sector for over 50 years. Advances in digitalisation have created opportunities to extract data, obtain insights and achieve greater situational awareness of a physical system’s performance. Increasing interest in the concept has led to a proliferation of digital twin definitions, which are used to frame discussions about specific digital twins. Consequentially comparison of the capabilities of specific digital twins is difficult as they are analysed using different definitions. This paper proposes an analysis framework that enables the characteristics of all digital twins to be matched to this framework. Using this framework, a digital twin may be characterised, or two or more digital twins may be compared. By establishing a framework that contains common functional characteristics, we aim to reduce the confusion caused by the plethora of digital twin definitions and their interpretation by suppliers. By focusing only on functionality and not addressing non-functional requirements the analysis allows comparison of different physical and logical instantiations of digital twins.},

Firstly, it surveys the development of the definition of DT and compares its concepts with the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, and digital thread etc. Next, it shows the research timeline of aviation DT in the past 10 years by authorities such as Air Force Research Laboratory and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Then, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art research status of DT in the whole lifecycle of the aviation system and concludes that aviation DT is the most widely used in manufacturing and maintenance, and should pay attention to the application of UAV DT. Finally, it summarizes that data fusion, high-fidelity modeling, integration with New IT, and human–machine interaction are the key technologies of aviation DT. The future possible research directions could be digital process twin risk control, interactive DT, and DT data learning.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O\&G) industry is now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity, efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the O\&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows O\&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O\&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O\&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O\&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O\&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O\&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O\&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O\&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O\&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O\&G industry is still at an early stage.},

	abstract = {One of the most promising technologies that is driving digitalization in several industries is Digital Twin (DT). DT refers to the digital replica or model of any physical object (physical twin). What differentiates DT from simulation and other digital or CAD models is the automatic bidirectional exchange of data between digital and physical twins in real-time. The beneﬁts of implementing DT in any sector include reduced operational costs and time, increased productivity, better decision making, improved predictive/preventive maintenance, etc. As a result, its implementation is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades as, with the advent of Industry 4.0, products and systems have become more intelligent, relaying on collection and storing incremental amounts of data. Connecting that data effectively to DTs can open up many new opportunities and this paper explores different industrial sectors where the implementation of DT is taking advantage of these opportunities and how these opportunities are taking the industry forward. The paper covers the applications of DT in 13 different industries including the manufacturing, agriculture, education, construction, medicine, and retail, along with the industrial use case in these industries.},

Despite its importance, this endeavor has little precedent to rely on to inform the many challenges it needs to address. Digital Twin, in recent years, has been employed in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we explore its usefulness in establishing the Artemis Base Camp. Digital twins can be applied to various stages of the lifecycle of the lunar base development. We also identify several open questions that need be addressed before the digital twin can be utilized effectively in this project.

Numerous data-driven RUL prediction approaches have been proposed and achieved impressive performance in RUL prediction. However, most of them are still faced with the dilemma of limited samples, and most of popular transfer learning and domain adaptive methods adopt single-source domain adaptation (DA), ignoring the domain-shift within source domain and failing to fully utilize the multi-condition data. This article proposes a model-data fusion life prediction method based on digital twin (DT) and multi-source regression adversarial domain adaptation (MRADA) to address the aforementioned issues. For data-driven life prediction model, the model-based DT technology among them offers a significant amount of multi-condition training data. The proposed MRADA fully utilizes the benefits of DT simulation data by using intra-group alignment strategy, inter-group alignment strategy, adversarial learning, and regressor alignment strategy to learn domain-invariant features and supervision from multiple sources. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed fusion life prediction method can successfully address the issue of small samples and improve the accuracy of rolling bearing life prediction results.},

First applied in manufacturing, the movement known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution soon spread and changed the dynamics of many other fields. Digital twins (DTs), one of the technologies that emerged in this scenario, are used to replicate physical environments in virtual models. Such models must be supplied with up-to-date information throughout a product's lifecycle to ensure accurate representation of the real asset. DTs have great potential to impact the construction industry, supporting facilities management, simulation tasks, and centralized management and recording of interventions. However, despite the attention the theme has attracted among researchers and companies, implementation of the concept in practical situations is still largely underexplored. Thus, this study aims to critically analyze the concept of DTs and their potential in the construction industry, particularly in inspection and maintenance tasks for existing structures. The study comprises a literature review undertaken to identify the multiple types of DT models, examine barriers and opportunities associated with their use, and discuss their potential as enablers of inspection and maintenance strategies. Furthermore, research opportunities related to the use of DTs for structural inspection and maintenance are suggested.},

	abstract = {Digital twin, a new emerging and fast-growing technology which is one of the most promising technologies for smart design and manufacturing, has attracted much attention worldwide recently. With the application of digital twin, product performance evaluation has entered the data-driven era. However, traditional methods for evaluation mainly place emphasis on structure analysis in the stage of manufacturing and service in digital twin. They cannot synthesize multi-source information and take the high-level emotional response into consideration in the design stage. To overcome these disadvantages, a digital twin-driven method is proposed evaluating product design schemes in this study. It enables the acquisition of electroencephalogram (EEG) data, physical data, and emotional feedback. Human factors are systematically considered in the evaluation process to establish the information association between EEG and performance levels. Moreover, intelligent psycho-physiological analysis that incorporates EEG into the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) and machine learning methods is adopted within the proposed method. It synthesizes human factors such as psychological requirements, subjective and objective assessment indicators to realize a novel machine learning-based EEG analysis. Taking advantage of the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) improved Riemannian manifold mapping, Riemann geometry (RG) features are extracted and selected from EEG signals. Differences of implicit psychological states while using the product produced by different design schemes can be more easily detected and classified. A case study of high-speed elevator is conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The accuracy of EEG classification for performance evaluation reaches 92\%.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which has made manufacturing processes more smart, efficient and sustainable, has received increasing attention from the industry and academia. As one of the most important applications for IoT, sustainable smart manufacturing enables lower cost, higher productivity and flexibility, better quality and sustainability during the product lifecycle management. Over the years, numerous enterprises have promoted the implementation of both sustainable and smart manufacturing. In the Industry 4.0 context, a ‘digital twin’ is widely used to achieve smart manufacturing, although this approach often ignores sustainability. This study aims to simultaneously consider digital twin and big data technologies to propose a sustainable smart manufacturing strategy based on information management systems for energy-intensive industries (EIIs) from the product lifecycle perspective. The integration of digital twin and big data provides key technologies for data acquisition in energy-intensive production environments, prediction and mining in uncertain environments as well as real-time control in complex working conditions. Moreover, a digital twin-driven operation mechanism and an overall framework of big data cleansing and integration are designed to explain and illustrate sustainable smart manufacturing. Two case studies from Southern and Northern China demonstrate the efficacy of the strategy, with the results showing that Companies A and B achieved the goals of energy saving and cost reduction after implementing the proposed strategy. By applying an energy management system, the unit energy consumption and energy cost of production in Company A decreased by at least 3\%. In addition, the ‘cradle-to-gate’ lifecycle big data analysis indicates that the costs of environmental protection in Company B decrease significantly. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and some managerial insights for EIIs in China are analysed and discussed.},

	abstract = {The emergence of the digital twin concept can potentially change the way people manage built assets thoroughly. This is because the semantics-based model and linked data approach behind the digital twin, as the successor of classical BIM, provide strong capability in integrating data from fragmented and heterogeneous sources and thus enable better-informed decision-making. Taking buildings as the case, this paper demonstrates the ontology-based Information Management Framework and elaborates on the process to integrate data through a common data model. Specifically, the Foundation Data Model (FDM) representing the operation of buildings and embedded systems is developed and two patterns of integration architecture are compared. To conceptualise all the essential entities and relationships, the building topology ontology and BRICK ontology are reused and merged to serve as a feasible FDM. According to the characteristic of asset management services that digital twins support, two integration architectures are compared, including the data warehouse approach and the mediator approach. A case study is presented to elaborate on the implementation of these two approaches and their applicability. This work sets out the standardised and modularised paradigms for discovering, fetching, and integrating data from disparate sources with different data curation manners.},

In response to this problem, this paper proposes a digital twin-based product lifecycle information fusion method from the perspective of Product Lifecycle Management, eliminating the problem of information silos among systems, and completing multidimensional data fusion in three aspects: the creation of multidimensional models, construction of ternary data models, and integration of multi-system service information.

Following the principles of intelligent perception of information, risk assessment, and intelligent decision-making, a set of intelligent risk assessment and control methods for highway traffic is established based on the integration of static and dynamic traffic infrastructure information. Firstly, IoT (Internet of Things) technology is utilized to achieve intelligent perception of dynamic information such as traffic and environment based on the foundation of static data. Multiple-source fusion cloud databases are built in the digital twin system. Secondly, a road segment risk identification using KNN-SVR (K-Nearest Neighbor Support Vector Regression) neural network is proposed. Additionally, a vehicle risk coupling model is introduced to determine the form of traffic risk. Lastly, a rule-based reasoning (RBR) and case-based reasoning (CBR) technology are employed to establish decision support libraries for system and case decisions, aiming to provide specialized support for control decisions.

The DTSDO is driven by the fundamental data of passengers and trains, and it uses the eEPCD to link and control the Six essential production elements within the station based on a time sequence. The communication between the PSPE and PSVE is established via the HTTP protocol. The DOTS accurately portrays the virtual representation of the reality passenger station.

	abstract = {Distribution room is a bridge in the power transmission system, where voltage or current of electric energy is transformed, centralized, and distributed. With the gradual expansion of the power grid, the number of distribution rooms has increased rapidly. However, traditional distribution rooms have low work efficiency and cannot meet the rapidly developing power supply scale and the high electricity demand of residents. In order to effectively maintain the stable and efficient operation of the power system, it is urgent to make changes to the operation and management of traditional distribution rooms. To address this issue, this article proposes a 4-level unmanned distribution room system architecture based on digital twin technology. It relies on digital twin technology to digitally model and physically map all elements of the distribution room, including the physical entity of the distribution room, the information-physical fusion of the distribution room, the digital twin modeling of the distribution room, and the intelligent operation and maintenance platform of the distribution room. By relying on real-time data transmission, it can achieve mutual mapping between physical space, physical objects, virtual space, and virtual objects. In this article, modeling tools such as Blender were used to model the three-dimensional spatial structure of the distribution room, construct a distribution room model in 3D space, and realize data interaction and real-time monitoring of the digital twin distribution room through an intelligent operation and maintenance platform. The feasibility of constructing a digital twin distribution room model was verified.},
