	abstract = {As the simulation model of a physical system, digital twin has been widely used in many complicated control systems. Providing an effective way to perform simulation, digital twin makes the evaluation, prediction and optimization process cheaper and easier than on physical systems. For smart manufacturing, digital twin achieves high productivity with less operation and maintenance cost. However, the advantages of digital twin in anomaly detection during manufacturing are always neglected. Taking a two-speed transmission system as an example, we generate three kinds of faults on this digital twin model. After extracting features from the system output, we train an anomaly detection model on these features to classify each type of fault. By this digital twin model, we can find the fault in the whole system at the very beginning, and reduce the time and cost of debugging and diagnosing.},

	abstract = {Implementing closed-loop control requires ensuring a robust system response against undesired disturbances and random fault events. To overcome these challenges, the controllers must be able to detect and adapt the process behavior against undesired events by adjusting its parameters accordingly. Developers have utilized the concept of a digital twin—a real-time representation of the physical process—to design and update the physical controller effectively. However, traditional digital twin implementations often involve significant data exchange between the digital system and the real asset through cloud platforms, leading to data latency and privacy issues. To mitigate these concerns, we propose an FPGA-based digital twin implementation where the information is directly sourced into the Digital Twin from the physical asset, which runs in parallel with the real system. This setup eliminates the need for big data transfers and cloud uploads, ensuring enhanced data privacy and facilitating a faster and more efficient digital twin implementation and update process. To demonstrate the capabilities of embedded Digital Twin, we present a case study involving monitoring a power converter system during a sensor fault scenario.},

	abstract = {The concept of twinning an operational physical system with a functional replica is not new, having been practiced in the space sector for over 50 years. Advances in digitalisation have created opportunities to extract data, obtain insights and achieve greater situational awareness of a physical system’s performance. Increasing interest in the concept has led to a proliferation of digital twin definitions, which are used to frame discussions about specific digital twins. Consequentially comparison of the capabilities of specific digital twins is difficult as they are analysed using different definitions. This paper proposes an analysis framework that enables the characteristics of all digital twins to be matched to this framework. Using this framework, a digital twin may be characterised, or two or more digital twins may be compared. By establishing a framework that contains common functional characteristics, we aim to reduce the confusion caused by the plethora of digital twin definitions and their interpretation by suppliers. By focusing only on functionality and not addressing non-functional requirements the analysis allows comparison of different physical and logical instantiations of digital twins.},

	abstract = {One of the most promising technologies that is driving digitalization in several industries is Digital Twin (DT). DT refers to the digital replica or model of any physical object (physical twin). What differentiates DT from simulation and other digital or CAD models is the automatic bidirectional exchange of data between digital and physical twins in real-time. The beneﬁts of implementing DT in any sector include reduced operational costs and time, increased productivity, better decision making, improved predictive/preventive maintenance, etc. As a result, its implementation is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades as, with the advent of Industry 4.0, products and systems have become more intelligent, relaying on collection and storing incremental amounts of data. Connecting that data effectively to DTs can open up many new opportunities and this paper explores different industrial sectors where the implementation of DT is taking advantage of these opportunities and how these opportunities are taking the industry forward. The paper covers the applications of DT in 13 different industries including the manufacturing, agriculture, education, construction, medicine, and retail, along with the industrial use case in these industries.},

Numerous data-driven RUL prediction approaches have been proposed and achieved impressive performance in RUL prediction. However, most of them are still faced with the dilemma of limited samples, and most of popular transfer learning and domain adaptive methods adopt single-source domain adaptation (DA), ignoring the domain-shift within source domain and failing to fully utilize the multi-condition data. This article proposes a model-data fusion life prediction method based on digital twin (DT) and multi-source regression adversarial domain adaptation (MRADA) to address the aforementioned issues. For data-driven life prediction model, the model-based DT technology among them offers a significant amount of multi-condition training data. The proposed MRADA fully utilizes the benefits of DT simulation data by using intra-group alignment strategy, inter-group alignment strategy, adversarial learning, and regressor alignment strategy to learn domain-invariant features and supervision from multiple sources. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed fusion life prediction method can successfully address the issue of small samples and improve the accuracy of rolling bearing life prediction results.},

Firstly, IoT (Internet of Things) technology is utilized to achieve intelligent perception of dynamic information such as traffic and environment based on the foundation of static data. Multiple-source fusion cloud databases are built in the digital twin system. Secondly, a road segment risk identification using KNN-SVR (K-Nearest Neighbor Support Vector Regression) neural network is proposed. Additionally, a vehicle risk coupling model is introduced to determine the form of traffic risk. Lastly, a rule-based reasoning (RBR) and case-based reasoning (CBR) technology are employed to establish decision support libraries for system and case decisions, aiming to provide specialized support for control decisions.

	abstract = {Distribution room is a bridge in the power transmission system, where voltage or current of electric energy is transformed, centralized, and distributed. With the gradual expansion of the power grid, the number of distribution rooms has increased rapidly. However, traditional distribution rooms have low work efficiency and cannot meet the rapidly developing power supply scale and the high electricity demand of residents. In order to effectively maintain the stable and efficient operation of the power system, it is urgent to make changes to the operation and management of traditional distribution rooms. To address this issue, this article proposes a 4-level unmanned distribution room system architecture based on digital twin technology. It relies on digital twin technology to digitally model and physically map all elements of the distribution room, including the physical entity of the distribution room, the information-physical fusion of the distribution room, the digital twin modeling of the distribution room, and the intelligent operation and maintenance platform of the distribution room. By relying on real-time data transmission, it can achieve mutual mapping between physical space, physical objects, virtual space, and virtual objects. In this article, modeling tools such as Blender were used to model the three-dimensional spatial structure of the distribution room, construct a distribution room model in 3D space, and realize data interaction and real-time monitoring of the digital twin distribution room through an intelligent operation and maintenance platform. The feasibility of constructing a digital twin distribution room model was verified.},

	abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology surrounded by many promises, and potentials to reshape the future of industries and society overall. A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry, infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable research dimensions for future developments in DTs.},

	abstract = {Building digital twin (BDT) is utilized throughout the lifecycle of a building. It serves for efficient operations during the design and construction phases, and during the operational and maintenance phases, it’s used for asset management and as field maps for robots. Building Information Modeling (BIM), which contains both semantics and geometry data of building elements, holds promise as a data source for BDT. We have extracted four key technical challenges of the digital twin, particularly vital during the operational and maintenance phases: software, visualization, update, and real-scene reconstruction. Due to the exclusive and static nature of BIM, these challenges also pose significant issues in the context of BDT. To address these challenges, we designed and implemented a Web-based BIM platform. The implemented application shows not only geometry data but also semantics data, enables easy overlay with the latest indoor conditions, and provides updating functionality. The developed system is essential for the continuous operation of BDT in dynamic indoor environments. We evaluated the application through a questionnaire survey.},

Powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and security technologies, DT-IIoT provides advanced features such as real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, remote diagnostics, and rapid response for smart IIoT systems. A systematic review of key enabling technologies such as digital twin, AI, and blockchain is essential to develop DT-IIoT and reveal pitfalls. This paper reviews the preliminaries, real-world applications, architectures and models of digital twin-driven IIoT. In addition, advanced technologies for intelligent and secure DT-IIoT are investigated, including state-of-the-art AI solutions such as transfer learning and federated learning, as well as blockchain-based security solutions. Moreover, software tools for high-fidelity digital twin modeling are proposed. A case study on reinforcement learning-based integrated-control, communication, and computing (3C) design is developed to demonstrate the AI-driven intelligent DT-IIoT.

	abstract = {Water resources have spurred the need for advanced maritime technologies, particularly for effective exploration and harnessing. Traditional maritime resource investigation methodologies are hampered by challenges such as elevated costs and risks. Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have emerged as a transformative solution, offering applications previously unattainable or challenging with conventional ships. An essential element in enhancing the capabilities of USVs is the incorporation of “Digital Twin” (DT) technology, a digital representation mirroring a system's real-world attributes and behaviours. While DT's application has gained traction in other sectors, notably in autonomous vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles, a focused exploration of its integration in USVs remains sparse. This paper bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive survey of DT within the context of USVs. We review prevailing DT methodologies, delve into multifaceted perspectives surrounding DT-including definitions, classifications and key features, and highlight the prospective directions and challenges for its future application in USVs. Through this study, we underscore the potential of DT in enhancing the capabilities, productivity, and sustainability of USVs in complex maritime environments.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an alternative approach for the implementation of a test system for testing the automotive sensor interfaces used in Electronic Control Units (ECU). In the automotive industry, the development and testing of electronic modules are largely obeying the standard ISO26262-5, which provides methodologies and addresses the specific safety aspects. The development methodology considers multiple aspects – starting from the general requirements of the final product (the ECU), going through system architecture, hardware, software, and mechanical design, and eventually the verification and validation of the product. Everything is covered under the V-model design concept. The standard did not specify which kind of test equipment should be used, it focuses on the necessity of verification and validation of the final product. Testing activity can be merged into the methodology and modeled by creating a digital twin of the test equipment, whose parameters (inputs and outputs) are part of the bigger development model of the ECU. This paper proposes an improved and combined development and test methodology, focused on the hardware development of automotive sensor interfaces. In the case of sensor interfaces of ECUs, the sensors are external components of the system, and requirements refer to sensor interface features and functionality. Therefore, the test equipment can emulate the real sensors, with additional features allowing testing of all development requirements.},

Automakers aim to improve development efficiency of the automotive cyber-physical systems in the fierce market competition. However, the actual development process suffers from the challenges of long development cycle and poor scalability. To tackle these challenges, this article develops a digital twinning based adaptive development environment for automotive cyber-physical systems, which addresses two critical problems: each physical entity (i.e., electronic control unit, component, test source, etc.) needs to clone a corresponding digital twin; digital twins and the physical entities need to interact closely. The first problem is addressed through proposing an integrated digital twinning clone flow. The second problem is addressed through developing a smart digital twinning board. Our case study with the automotive body control system demonstrates that the adaptive development environment achieves a high adaptability with short development cycle, low complexity, low cost, high scalability, and high flexibility, which meet various automotive cyber-physical design requirements during the development process.},

	abstract = {This research addresses the crucial need for robust passenger protection systems in EVs. The proposed passenger and vehicle system safety model aligns with the Formula Student rulebook's guidelines. The novel aspect of the research is the creation of a comprehensive safety shutdown circuit for electric vehicles (EVs) through integrating and optimizing numerous safety mechanisms and designing a digital twin model for the same for efficient testing and validation procedures. Using a Simulink model to mimic critical scenarios and evaluate system performance with different test inputs provides a practical application to the research. The proposed shutdown circuit comprises several safety mechanisms, including Low Voltage Master Switch (LVMS), Tractive system master switch (TSMS), Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD), Insulation Monitoring Device (IMD), Accumulator Management System (AMS), Inertia Switch, Brake over travel switch (BOTS), and interlocks. Each of the elements mentioned is critical for detecting and responding to potential failure hazards which contributes to making the model an efficient and reliable shutdown system. Furthermore, the use of a digital twin safety system modeling technique with a focus on real-time observation via an interactive dashboard distinguishes this research by filling a gap in existing EV safety systems realm helping to promote confidence and acceptance of electric vehicles sustainability transporting goods and passengers for a greener tomorrow.},

To date, most research groups focused instead on developing highly specialised, highly focused patient-specific models able to predict specific quantities of clinical relevance. While it has facilitated harvesting the low-hanging fruits, this narrow focus is, in the long run, leaving some significant challenges that slow the adoption of digital twins in healthcare. This position paper lays the conceptual foundations for developing the Virtual Human Twin (VHT). The VHT is intended as a distributed and collaborative infrastructure, a collection of technologies and resources (data, models) that enable it, and a collection of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that regulate its use. The VHT infrastructure aims to facilitate academic researchers, public organisations, and the biomedical industry in developing and validating new digital twins in healthcare solutions with the possibility of integrating multiple resources if required by the specific context of use. Healthcare professionals and patients can also use the VHT infrastructure for clinical decision support or personalised health forecasting. As the European Commission launched the EDITH coordination and support action to develop a roadmap for the development of the Virtual Human Twin, this position paper is intended as a starting point for the consensus process and a call to arms for all stakeholders.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the cybersecurity attacks on the internet of things (IoT)-based healthcare systems became the major concern for researchers and health organizations. With time, the sophistication of these attacks is increasing. Therefore, healthcare service providers must implement efficient security mechanisms carefully while taking the advantages of connected devices without compromising the patient safety and disturbing the real-time health services. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a real-time counterpart of a physical world. DT offers significant advantages to cybersecurity experts, empowering them to predict risks without entering the physical world, and to simulate and test cyber-attacks that would otherwise be infeasible to do in real-time in the physical environment. DT in healthcare helps to identify security vulnerabilities, conduct attack simulations, and potential security breaches by creating a virtual replica of the targeted healthcare systems. In this paper, a novel and automated conceptual framework is developed for reinforcing the cybersecurity in IoT-based healthcare using DT technology. It includes the conceptualization and analysis of the proposed framework which can provide dynamic and adaptive security solution to identify real-time threats and vulnerabilities in IoTbased healthcare applications.},
